# Project 1: House Price Prediction: Project Overview
- Formulated a tool that estimates the saleprice of houses in Ames, Iowa based on 79 explanatory variables.
- Utilized supervised learning algorithms (regression techniques) to predict the house prices based on different features of the houses. 
- Engineered features from the year houses were built and modified to quanitfy the age of the unit and modification.
- Implemented Backward Stepwise Regression to eliminate independant variables based on statistical significance in order to retain only the most influential features for the modeling. 
- Optimized Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor using GridSearchCVto land the best model fit.
